1) Assignment
2) arithemtic +,-,*,/,%,**
3) Relational Operators : > , >=  , <= , == , ===
    Returns boolean values
4) Logical Operators :
    AND (&&)
    OR  (||)
    NOT (!)
    Used mostly between Relational Operators
    Returns boolean values

    AND operator return true only in the event of all statements equating to true
    OR Operator Return False only in the event that all expresssion equate to false
    NOT Operator Negates the logic state
5) Increment and Decrement Operators (++ , --)
6) Shorthand Operators
    assume x = x + y which can be shorthanded to x+= y
7) Ternary
    condition ? true statement : false statement

Conditional Statements (decision making statements)
---------------------------------------------------
1) if else
    syntax
        if(condition){

        }else{
            //statements
        }
2) switch

In js data can be inputted via the prompt method which uses a popup or we can collect user
input from HTML input box

Looping Statements
    To do task repeatedly at particular position of programming file
1) while loop
        syntax:
            variable initialization
            while(condition){
                statements;
                exit condition/ increment|decrement operation
            }
2) for loop

01/02/2025
 we can convert string to number by Number() method

parseInt(),Math.floor() ,removes decimal part of number

break; keyword can forcefully break from the loop

04/02/2025
for loop
syntax:  for(variable initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement){
        // statements
    }

if we know the exact number of iterations beforehand we can prefer for loops,
and we use while loop when we can't predetermine the iterations

Functions()
functions are set of instructions to do a certain operation multiple times based on condition
function has two parts 1) function definition 2)  function call

function function_name(arguments){
    Statements
}

function call = function_name()

Variables inside the function has only function scope and can't be accessed outisde function

in order to access variables outside the function 'return' keyword is Used
return should be the last statement inside  a function or statements after return stement won't be executed


Arrow Functions
from ES6 version arrow functions are preferred over arrow functions

syntax:
    const variable/function_name = () => { /*
      statements */ }

if there is only single line in function there is no need for {}
and return is automatically done furthermore there is no need for return keyword explicitly

arrow functions have no functional hoisting whereas normal functions have hoisting


:: Callback Functions ::
A function calling another function is called callback .
Callback functions are passed as arguments to another function and is executed after the funtion completes its execution

:: Predefined Funcuitons ::
function that are already built into the language to make applications development
easier
egs: Math.floor(), console.log()

:: Nested Function ::
A function defined inside another function is called nested

  Closure Property
  Closure is the ability of variables inside parents function be accessible to child
  function but the variable inside the child function not being accessible to the parent
  function

Synchronous and Asynchronous
    Synchronous functions are functions which have no time delay
    Asynchronous functions will have a time delay eg: setTimeout , API Fetching


Data Structures
- a specialized format/container for storing ,processsing , retrieving , organizing data
eg: array , list , string , there

Array:
unlike variables an array can store data with 1 or more datatypes that are separatd by a comma
and enclosed by  square brackets;
format:  let arrayname = [];

object stores data in key:value pairs all enclosed by curly brackets {}.
